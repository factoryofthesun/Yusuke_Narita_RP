#### Hearing the Voice of the Future: Comments and Suggestions ####

## Presentation Comments ## 

Motivations
- Though the improved outcome of weighting the youth vote higher is assumed (bye Trump!),
it would be nice to see some discussion arguing for the normative value of this idea 
(e.g. younger people have to live with the consequences of political outcomes for longer)
- I know there has also been some work done on the representativeness of voter turnout vs 
  national demographics, so you could reference that work in this section as well.

Data Validation
- How accurately do the datasets match known public data on party representation in
  each state? 
- Does the demographic breakdown of your data match Voter turnout statistics? 

Standard Error Calculations
- I assume this is in the works, but just in case it doesn't seem like there's anything
that prevents you from doing the same SE work on the L2 data as you did with the ANES data. 

Section A.2 
 - In the section "Testing Significant Differences between Party Vote Shares", it says the 
   p-value results reported in table 6 are from the counterfactual Dem/Rep t-test, but in the
   table caption the p-values are ascribed to the winning party/runner-up t-test. Probably should
   iron out this discrepancy. 
 - There is no mention of the p-value results from table 5. 

## Ideas for Extended Analysis/Discussion ## 

Future Weight Trends Based on Life Expectancy Outlook 
- Given predictions of future demographic shifts and life expectancies, how would the 
weighted vs non-weighted vote share of each age group change? 
- How would the addition of weighted votes influence the projected outcomes of future elections?

Different functional forms for weights
- Seeing how the counterfactual changes with different transformations applied to the life
  expectancy weights (log, squared, etc)
- Related: what is the minimum amount of reweighting that would have achieved the Clinton
  counterfactual victory in 2016? 

Augmenting vote share estimation using voter turnout data
- It was unclear whether turnout information was available in the L2 data for 2016, but if it wasn't
  then maybe you could use turnout statistics to try to produce better estimates of 2016 vote share.

Simulating Changes to the Electoral College
- How would the results change if instead of winner-takes-all states adopted the Maine/Nebraska model? 
- How accurate are the party vote share estimations on a district level?
